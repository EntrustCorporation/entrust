# Golang client for the Entrust Certificate Services Enterprise API

This is a simple and (currently) only partial implementation of the API.

**This project is made available by Entrust Corporation under the [MIT license](LICENSE).** As such the client is provided to you AS IS and without warranty, as further detailed in the MIT license.

## Config

| Environment variable            | Value                            |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `ENTRUST_API_CERTIFICATE`       | PEM encoded client certificate   |
| `ENTRUST_API_CERTIFICATE_PATH`  | Client certificate path          |
| `ENTRUST_API_PRIVATE_KEY`       | PEM encoded private key          |
| `ENTRUST_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`  | Private key path                 |
| `ENTRUST_API_USERNAME`          | API Username                     |
| `ENTRUST_API_PASSWORD`          | API Password (API Key)           |

The environment variables `ENTRUST_API_CERTIFICATE` and `ENTRUST_API_PRIVATE_KEY` take presedence over `ENTRUST_API_CERTIFICATE_PATH` and `ENTRUST_API_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`.

## Obtaining credentials

These credentials can be obtained via the Entrust Certificate Services Enterprise Portal (Enterprise Portal, Administration > Advanced Settings > API). In order to obtain an account and related credentials, you must have an active subscription or other entitlement from Entrust for Entrust Certificate Services (ECS).

# Security

The Entrust credentials provide strong entitlements and can have a devastating impact to your organisation or service when not secured properly. Itâ€™s your sole responsibility to store these credentials securely and restrict API credentials to the resources and capabilities as required.

**Do not put any credential directly in your configuration file!**
